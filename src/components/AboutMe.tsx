                Griffith University graduate with commercial experience in
                developing games and web applications. Over the past few years I
                have spent time between Los Angeles and Australia working for a
                variety of companies in both web development and game developer.
                I am currently based in Los Angeles for the foreseeable future.{" "}
                <br />
                <br /> For the past year and a half I have spent my time with
                Splash working on a music based Roblox game using Lua, Roact and
                Rojo. With Splash I have gone from a junior game developer and
                worked towards a team lead role helping with weekly production
                deployments. <br />
                <br />
                Prior to my time with Splash I worked with Codafication and
                contributed to developing software for insurance companies
                making use of React, NodeJS, TypeScript, GraphQL, Docker,
                Kubernetes and PostgreSQL. <br />
                <br />
                My first LA based job with Coin Crew Games allowed me to help
                prototype arcade games using C# and Unity as well as helping to
                construct the game cabinets. During this time I was also working
                as a tech at Two Bit Circus, a VR based arcade to continue
                growing my understanding of the industry on both the developer
                and consumer side of the business.
                <br />
                <br />
                My spare time has been spent dabbling in data analytics making
                use of Selenium and Beautiful Soup to collect data used to
                predict bets in eSports as well as continuing to develop my
                JavaScript/React skills along with some Roblox game development.
                I am constantly looking for new opportunities to continue to
                devleop my wide range of skills and continue growing in the
                software developer world.
